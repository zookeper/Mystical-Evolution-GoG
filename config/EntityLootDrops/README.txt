UNDERSTANDING 'GLOBAL' FILES:
============================
Files with 'Global' in the name apply to ALL entities/blocks/fishing of that type:
- Global_Hostile_Drops.json: ALL hostile mobs
- Global_Block_Drops.json: ALL blocks
- Global_Fishing_Rewards.json: ALL fishing attempts

More specific files (like individual mob files) take priority over global files.

IMPORTANT - HOW TO DISABLE DROPS:
=================================
Many users ask how to disable drops without deleting files.
Here are the methods that work for ALL drop types:

Method 1 - Empty Array (Disables ALL drops in a file):
Replace the entire file content with: []

Method 2 - Set Drop Chance/Chance to 0 (and Command Chance):
- For entity drops: Set "dropChance": 0 AND "commandChance": 0
- For fishing drops: Set "chance": 0
- For block drops: Set "dropChance": 0 AND "commandChance": 0
(This disables both item drops AND command execution)

Method 3 - Set Amounts to 0 (Alternative):
Set "minAmount": 0 and "maxAmount": 0

WHY NOT DELETE FILES?
- Main config files (like Global_Hostile_Drops.json) will regenerate
- You'll lose your custom configurations
- Example files are safe to delete and will regenerate with updates

Configuration Tips:
------------------
1. Start with Global_Hostile_Drops.json for drops that apply to all hostile mobs
2. Use the Mobs/ folders for entity-specific configurations
3. Create custom .json files to organize your drops by theme
4. Use events for seasonal or temporary drops
5. Test with debug logging enabled: /lootdrops debug true
6. Use /lootdrops reload to apply changes without restarting
7. To disable drops: Use [] or set chances to 0 - DON'T delete main files!

Each directory contains its own README file with detailed instructions.
